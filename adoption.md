# Adoption of Other Projects

The Open Integration Engine may adopt other projects. This includes, but is not limited to, forking other open source projects, donations of existing open source projects, or other intellectual property of value to Open Integration Engine and our community.

## License Compatibilty

Any project that OIE incorporates _MUST_ have an appropriate license.

This is critical for code that is incorporated to our main repos - this code _MUST_ be under the same license as the repo it is incorporated to. 

Code which is forked must have an appropriate license, preferably open-source that allows us to fork the project. The license must be clearly documented.

## Categories

### Forked

Open-source is open. OIE will fork other open source projects under our organizational umbrella.

We do this to preserve code, assist with other projects, and to otherwise support our work for the larger community.

OIE will do this with general consensus from the [Steering Committee](steering_committee.md) and [Maintainers](maintainers.md). 

### Donated

OIE has already had several donors assign copyright of their work to OIE. These donors generously supported the project with their work. This lets OIE own and maintain projects which valuable to the community. 

Donations of entire projects are accepted on a case-by-case basis, outside of the typical pull-request process. The steering committee, with input from maintainers, will review any offered donations. 

We will generally request assignment of copyright for donated projects. This is what differentiates a donation from a fork. Assignment of copyright to OIE represents us 

### Incorporated

After being forked or donated, some projects may be incorporated to the OpenIntegrationEngine. These are projects which are especially valuable can be incorporated to our main repositories.

This will be handled through our typical pull-request process. Any donated or forked repositories will be updated with documentation, links, flags, archival, etc. to indicate that they have been incorporated elsewhere.

Projects which are incorporated from forks will, as much as is practical, be incorporated in a way which allows us to continue to collaborate with up- or down-stream projects.

## Distribution

OIE may choose to build and distribute these projects. When doing so OIE _MUST_:

- ensure the projects are of sufficient quality and safety for their stated use
- ensure that distributions from OIE are appropriately reviewed and scanned for risks, vulnerabilities, and security best-practices
- ensure that distributions modified and built by OIE are signed by OIE
