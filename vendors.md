# Commercial Support Listings Policy

This project provides a public *Commercial Support* section as a courtesy to vendors. Inclusion does **not imply endorsement, verification, or evaluation** by the project maintainers.

## Content

Listings will include:

- **Vendor name**
- **Link** to the vendor's chosen landing page for more information
- **Information**
 - _Contact_ one or more links, URLs, or contact information
 - _Location_ where the primary location of the vendor is, including time zone
 - _Supported Regions_ regions where the vendor offers services
 - _Logo_ a logo in a common image format suitable for display in varying sizes
- **Listing of Common Services** These categories are set by OIE and are meant to give a quick overview of services offered. If these categories change, current vendors will be contacted to update their listing.
 - _Contributor_ a link to open-source contribututions by the vendor
 - _Integration and Interface Services_ a yes/no indication if the vendor provides services to implement, support, or alter integrations running on OIE

- **References** to the vendors participation within the community. This includes but is not limited to links to PRs, links to forks, or community commentary about their participation. 

The project reserves the right to:

- Control and limit tag selection for clarity and space
- Deny or remove listings that violate community standards or appear misleading

The project shall not mediate disputes between vendors and clients. We are offering a listing, not a certification or endorsement. 

## Vendor Expectations

Vendors are expected to follow community guidelines.

Vendors can be de-listed by a simple majority vote of the steering committee. We expect to never have to do this. 

## Limitations and Disclaimer

All linked content is maintained by the vendor. The project does **not**:

- Verify any claims made by vendors
- Support or guarantee vendor services
- Intervene in disputes between users and vendors

Users should **perform their own due diligence** before engaging with any listed vendor. 

## Get Listed

The process to get listed is enumerated in the [vendors repository](https://github.com/OpenIntegrationEngine/vendors).
